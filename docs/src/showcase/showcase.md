# [The SciML Showcase](@id showcase)

The SciML Showcase is a display of some cool things that can be done by connecting SciML software.

!!! note
    
    The SciML Showcase is not meant to be training/tutorials, but inspirational
    demonstrations! If you're looking for simple examples to get started with, check out
    the [getting started section](@ref getting_started).
