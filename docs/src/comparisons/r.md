# [Getting Started with Julia's SciML for the R User](@id r)

If you're an R user who has looked into Julia, you're probably wondering where all of the
scientific computing packages are. How do I solve ODEs? Solve f(x)=0 for x? Etc. SciML
is the ecosystem for doing this with Julia.

## Why SciML? High-Level Workflow Reasons

  - **Performance** - The key reason people are moving from R to Julia's SciML in droves
    is performance. Even [simple ODE solvers are much faster!](https://benchmarks.sciml.ai/stable/MultiLanguage/ode_wrapper_packages/),
    demonstrating orders of magnitude performance improvements for differential equations,
    nonlinear solving, optimization, and more. And the performance advantages continue to
    grow as more complex algorithms are required.
  - **Composable Library Components** - In R environments, every package feels like
    a silo. Functions made for one file exchange library cannot easily compose with another.
    SciML's generic coding with JIT compilation these connections create new optimized code on
    the fly and allow for a more expansive feature set than can ever be documented. Take
    [new high-precision number types from a package](https://github.com/JuliaArbTypes/ArbFloats.jl)
    and stick them into a nonlinear solver. Take
    [a package for Intel GPU arrays](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl) and stick it into
    the differential equation solver to use specialized hardware acceleration.
  - **A Global Harmonious Documentation for Scientific Computing** - R's documentation for
    scientific computing is scattered in a bunch of individual packages where the developers
    do not talk to each other! This not only leads to documentation differences, but also
    “style” differences: one package uses `tol` while the other uses `atol`. With Julia's
    SciML, the whole ecosystem is considered together, and inconsistencies are handled at the
    global level. The goal is to be working in one environment with one language.
  - **Easier High-Performance and Parallel Computing** - With Julia's ecosystem,
    [CUDA](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) will automatically install of the required
    binaries and `cu(A)*cu(B)` is then all that's required to GPU-accelerate large-scale
    linear algebra. [MPI](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl) is easy to install and
    use. [Distributed computing through password-less SSH](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/distributed-computing/). [Multithreading](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/)
    is automatic and baked into many libraries, with a specialized algorithm to ensure
    hierarchical usage does not oversubscribe threads. Basically, libraries give you a lot
    of parallelism for free, and doing the rest is a piece of cake.
  - **Mix Scientific Computing with Machine Learning** - Want to [automate the discovery
    of missing physical laws using neural networks embedded in differentiable simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385)? Julia's SciML is the ecosystem with the tooling to integrate machine
    learning into the traditional high-performance scientific computing domains, from
    multiphysics simulations to partial differential equations.

In this plot, `deSolve` in blue represents R's most commonly used solver:

## Need Help Translating from R to Julia?

The following resources can be particularly helpful when adopting Julia for SciML for the
first time:

  - [The Julia Manual's Noteworthy Differences from R page](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-R)
  - [Tutorials on Data Wrangling and Plotting in Julia (Sections 4 and 5)](http://tutorials.pumas.ai/)
    written for folks with a background in R.
  - Double-check your results with [deSolveDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/deSolveDiffEq.jl)
    (automatically converts and runs ODE definitions with R's deSolve solvers)
  - Use [RCall.jl](https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/stable/) to more incrementally move
    code to Julia.
  - [Comparisons between R and Julia from the DataFrames package](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/man/comparisons/). And an [accessible starting point for Julia's DataFrames](https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/12/24/minilanguage.html).

uses [ModelingToolkit](https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/) to translate R code to Julia, and achieves
**350x acceleration over R's popular deSolve** ODE solver package. But when the solve is
done purely in Julia, it achieves **2777x acceleration over deSolve**!
